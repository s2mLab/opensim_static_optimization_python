# What is this repo?

This is an implementation of a static optimization using OpenSim and Python

The example folder contains the code used to create the figures of the Michaud (submitted) paper: *Two efficient static optimization algorithms that account for muscle-tendon equilibrium: approaching the constraint Jacobian via a constant or a cubic spline function*
